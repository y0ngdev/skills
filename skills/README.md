# Examples

This folder contains example skills that demonstrate what's possible with Claude's skills system. These examples range from creative applications (art, music, design) to technical tasks (testing web apps, MCP server generation) to enterprise workflows (communications, branding, etc.).

Each skill is self-contained in its own folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing the instructions and metadata that Claude uses. Browse through these examples to get inspiration for your own skills or to understand different patterns and approaches.

Many of the example skills are open source (Apache 2.0). We've also included the document creation & editing skills that power [Claude's document capabilities](https://www.anthropic.com/news/create-files) under the hood in the [`docx`](./docx), [`pdf`](./pdf), [`pptx`](./pptx), and [`xlsx`](./xlsx) subfolders. These are source-available, not open source, but we wanted to share these with developers as a reference for more complex skills that are actively used in a production AI application.

**Note:** These are reference examples for inspiration and learning. They showcase general-purpose capabilities rather than organization-specific workflows or sensitive content.

## Disclaimer

**These skills are provided for demonstration and educational purposes only.** While some of these capabilities may be available in Claude, the implementations and behaviors you receive from Claude may differ from what is shown in these examples. These examples are meant to illustrate patterns and possibilities. Always test skills thoroughly in your own environment before relying on them for critical tasks.

# Document Skills

The [`docx`](./docx), [`pdf`](./pdf), [`pptx`](./pptx), and [`xlsx`](./xlsx) subfolders contain skills that Anthropic developed to help Claude create various document file formats. These skills demonstrate advanced patterns for working with complex file formats and binary data:

- **docx** - Create, edit, and analyze Word documents with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction
- **pdf** - Comprehensive PDF manipulation toolkit for extracting text and tables, creating new PDFs, merging/splitting documents, and handling forms
- **pptx** - Create, edit, and analyze PowerPoint presentations with support for layouts, templates, charts, and automated slide generation
- **xlsx** - Create, edit, and analyze Excel spreadsheets with support for formulas, formatting, data analysis, and visualization

**Important Disclaimer:** These document skills are point-in-time snapshots and are not actively maintained or updated. Versions of these skills ship pre-included with Claude. They are primarily intended as reference examples to illustrate how Anthropic approaches developing more complex skills that work with binary file formats and document structures.

# Try in Claude Code, Claude.ai, and the API

## Claude Code
You can register this repository as a Claude Code Plugin marketplace by running the following command in Claude Code:
```
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills
```

Then, to install a specific set of skills:
1. Select `Browse and install plugins`
2. Select `anthropic-agent-skills`
3. Select `document-skills` or `example-skills`
4. Select `Install now`

Alternatively, directly install either Plugin via:
```
/plugin install document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills
/plugin install example-skills@anthropic-agent-skills
```

After installing the plugin, you can use the skill by just mentioning it. For instance, if you install the `document-skills` plugin from the marketplace, you can ask Claude Code to do something like: "Use the PDF skill to extract the form fields from `path/to/some-file.pdf`"

## Claude.ai

These example skills are all already available to paid plans in Claude.ai.
